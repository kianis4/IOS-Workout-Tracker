## Technical Implementation

```swift
// Example of planned OpenAI integration architecture
struct AICoachingService {
    private let openAIClient: OpenAIClient
    private let userRepository: UserRepository
    private let workoutAnalytics: WorkoutAnalyticsEngine
    
    func generateAdvice(for exercise: Exercise, 
                        performance: [SetEntry],
                        trainingHistory: WorkoutHistory) async throws -> CoachingAdvice {
        // Sophisticated context preparation and prompt engineering
        // Implementation details omitted for brevity
    }
}
```
### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation of UI and business logic

## Implementation Highlights
### SwiftData Relationship Model
```swift
@Model final class WorkoutSplit {
    var name: String
    var isActive: Bool
    var workoutDays: Set<Int> // Days of week (0-6)
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var days: [SplitDay] = []
}

@Model final class SplitDay {
    var title: String
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var exercises: [Exercise] = []
}

@Model final class Exercise {
    var name: String
    var muscle: MuscleGroup
    var targetSets: Int
    var targetReps: Int
}

@Model final class SetEntry {
    var exercise: Exercise
    var weight: Double
    var reps: Int
    var date: Date
}
```
### Intelligent Date Selection UI

```swift
struct TodayView: View {
    @Query private var splits: [WorkoutSplit]
    @State private var selectedDate = Date()
    @State private var showCalendar = false
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack(spacing: 0) {
                DateScrollView(selectedDate: $selectedDate, 
                              showCalendarAction: { showCalendar = true })
                
                // Workout view implementation
            }
            .sheet(isPresented: $showCalendar) {
                CalendarPickerView(selectedDate: $selectedDate, 
                                  isPresented: $showCalendar)
            }
